            This article explains the components of computer architecture and its key types and gives a few notable examples.</h5>

        <h2>What Is Computer Architecture?</h2>
        <h5>Computer architecture refers to the end-to-end structure of a computer system that determines how its components interact with each other in helping to execute the machineâ€™s purpose (i.e., processing data), often avoiding any reference to the actual technical implementation.</h5>

        <h5 ><li style="background-color: tomato;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Computers are an integral element of any organizationâ€™s infrastructure, from the equipment employees use at the office to the cell phones and wearables they use to work from home. All computers, regardless of their size, are founded on a set of principles describing how hardware and software connect to make them function. This is what constitutes computer architecture.</li><br>

        <li style="width: 20rem;background-color: aquamarine;">  Computer architecture is the arrangement of the components that comprise a computer system and the engine at the core of the processes that drive its functioning. It specifies the machine interface for which programming languages and associated processors are designed.
        </li><br>
            
        <li>Complex instruction set computer (CISC) and reduced instruction set computer (RISC) are the two predominant approaches to the architecture that influence how computer processors function.<b>CISC</b> processors have one processing unit, auxiliary memory, and a tiny register set containing hundreds of unique commands. These processors execute a task with a single instruction, making a programmerâ€™s work simpler since fewer lines of code are required to complete the operation. This method utilizes less memory but may need more time to execute instructions.</li><br>
            
        <li>A reassessment led to the creation of high-performance computers based on the <b>RISC</b> architecture. The hardware is designed to be as basic and swift as possible, and sophisticated instructions can be executed with simpler ones.</h5></li>

            All modern websites and web applications are built using three 
            <em>fundamentals</em>
            technologies: HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. These are the languages of the web.
